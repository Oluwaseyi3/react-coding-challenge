# Skip Selection Page Redesign Task on WeWantWaste Skip Selection Page

## Redesign Approach

- I used create-react-app to initaite a fresh react project
- I listed out the following areas to be improved: mobile responsiveness, spacing & padding, colour contrasts, font sizing/contrast, selection modal, card user experience

 
 
 ## Technical Improvements made

*Responsiveness* : I used Tailwindcss to maintain UI responsiveness over all screen sizes. I also made use of Antd library for the Drawer and Stepper Components

*Resuable components* : I broke down the UI into smaller components, hence making the code highly resuable

*Call To Action modal* : I improved the existing modal and made the bottom drawer call to action based, hence improving the user experience 

*Handled empty or error skips* : I improved the user experience by adding loading features

*Image Loading* : I applied the native browser lazy-loading feature on card images to optimize initial loading time and improve performance without adding external dependencies.

*UI Improvements* : I added nice hover animations to the card components, giving it a nicer feel to interact with and a warm color contrast also. Also improved on the font sizing/contrast

*Api Handling*  : I fetched the api neatly, handling both error and loading states


## Technologies used

- React (with Hooks)

- Tailwind CSS

- Ant Design Library
